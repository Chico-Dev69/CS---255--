Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client of DriverPass is Laim, He wanted an online system such as a website in order to offer services
to new drivers to help them learn the DMV rules and practice road tests with tips on how to improve. The 
system would have 3 different packages that will suit the customers best. 
 
What did you do particularly well?
What I feel like I did well in was creating the diagrams. It took me a bit to understand it but after looking into more
information about them such as different resources and YouTube videos. I was able to grasp a deep understanding of
creating a diagram and understanding it.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had to choose a part to revise/improve it. I would choose my sequence  diagram, I felt that it did meet the requirements but 
now that I have time to look back at it. It could use some improvements.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The way I implemented the user needs into the system design is by carefully reviewing what were the needs they wanted. When considering user needs when 
designing an App, Game, or even a website, it is important to take their needs into consideration. Creating the picture of what they want to view
is the key to being successful. 


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

In the future, I would analyze and design a system by starting by receiving feedback to build upon the feedback I received in other to 
deliver is a good product.
